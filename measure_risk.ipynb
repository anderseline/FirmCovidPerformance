      "item 1a risk factors we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different sometimes materially different than we presently anticipate below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments could also affect our future resultswe may not realize the benefits anticipated from the frutarom acquisition which could adversely affect our business part of our growth strategy has included growth through acquisitions within the fragrance flavors natural ingredient industries and adjacencies the frutarom acquisition was our most significant acquisition and brings a significantly different customer base and new adjacent product categories to our business our expectations about the benefits of this acquisition are based on projections and assumptions about our combined businesses which depend on i our ability to maintain the current frutarom business ii our ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and iii our ability to cross sell the combined company s products we may encounter significant challenges achieving these anticipated benefits including the following potential disruption of or reduced growth in our historical core businesses due to diversion of management attention from our historical core business and uncertainty with our current customer and supplier relationships challenges arising from the expansion of our product offerings into adjacencies with which we have limited experience including functional foods and nutraceuticals coordinating and integrating research and development teams across technologies and products to enhance product development while reducing costs consolidating and integrating corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures and integrating and harmonizing business systems which may be more difficult than anticipated due to the significant number of acquisitions completed by frutarom over the past few years coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities and the direction of product development difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities cross selling opportunities and growth prospects from combining frutarom s business with our business the increased scale regulatory compliance costs and complexity of our operations retaining key employees suppliers and other partners retaining and efficiently managing frutarom s significantly expanded and decentralized customer base difficulties in anticipating and responding to actions that may be taken by competitors in response to the transaction and the assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of frutarom 13in addition our anticipated benefits of the acquisition of frutarom contemplate significant cost saving synergies which we expect to arise principally from facility consolidation and rationalization of supply chain relationships even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of frutarom with ours we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition if we are unable to identify and implement the anticipated cost savings or if the actions taken to implement such cost savings have unintended consequences on our other business operations if we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating frutarom we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition we could incur unanticipated expenses and charges and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected the frutarom acquisition resulted and may continue to result in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect the financial results of the combined company our financial results following the acquisition of frutarom were adversely affected by cash expenses and non cash accounting charges incurred in connection with the acquisition we expect these types of charges to continue as a result of the integration of the business and operations of frutarom as a result of the acquisition we assumed all of frutarom s liabilities including unknown and contingent liabilities due to the nature of the transaction and the characteristics of frutarom our ability to conduct extensive due diligence was limited and we may subsequently identify additional obligations including those that frutarom assumed in its prior acquisitions during the measurement period prior to our acquisition frutarom completed 47 acquisitions since 2011 including 22 since the beginning of 2016 our ability to accurately identify and assess the magnitude of the liabilities assumed by frutarom in these acquisitions was limited by among other things the information available to us and frutarom and the limited operating experience that frutarom has with these acquired entities if we are not able to completely assess the scope of these liabilities or if these liabilities are neither probable nor estimable at this time our future financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated reserves or charges unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting charges unexpected increases in taxes due a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition our incurrence of additional debt to pay the cash portion of the frutarom consideration increased our financial leverage and could adversely affect our future cash flows and cost of capital in connection with the acquisition of frutarom we borrowed approximately 3 3 billion of additional debt consisting of 2 8 billion of senior unsecured notes 350 0 million in term loans and 139 5 million of senior unsecured amortizing notes associated with the tangible equity units incurring this new debt significantly increased our leverage there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and or interest on this new debt could adversely affect our cash flows our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders through dividends or stock repurchases furthermore our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings if we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating it could adversely affect our future cost of funding liquidity and access to capital markets in addition our current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities including large acquisitions if we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and decentralized taste and frutarom customer base our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected as a result of our acquisition of frutarom the number of our customers significantly increased and became more decentralized our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large food beverage and consumer products companies these customers have faced in recent years growing competition from mid and small sized regional companies and companies focused on niche product categories in connection with vision 2020 we identified serving these small and mid sized clients as a key element of our business strategy and invested in this strategy through the introduction of tastepoint by iff in the us which resulted from the acquisitions of ottens flavors and david michael with the frutarom acquisition we have significantly expanded our customer base by approximately 39 000 customers composed principally of globally located small and mid sized companies this substantial increase in our customer base will require us to adjust our corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures and corporate sales and customer culture further we may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is diverse both with respect to the types of services they will require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products however if we are unable to successfully implement this strategy or gain market share with this growing customer base our future growth could be adversely affected 14our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer the market for flavors fragrances and natural ingredients is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multi national and specialized flavor fragrance and cosmetic ingredients companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors fragrances or cosmetic ingredients in the flavors industry we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product sub segments while others participate in many of our product sub segments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks as we continue to enter into adjacent markets such as cosmetic ingredients and recently through the frutarom acquisition functional foods specialty fine ingredients and health and wellness products we may face greater competition related risks in these markets than with our core historic flavor and fragrances businesses for example the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins some fine ingredients products manufactured by frutarom are less unique and more replaceable by competitors products there is no assurance that operating margins will not erode in the future which could substantially impact our business operating results and financial condition competition in our business is based on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of customer service the support provided by marketing and application groups and understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing scale and success of our competitors actions in these areas in particular the discovery and development of new flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an adverse impact on sales and profitability if we are unable to provide our customers with innovative cost effective products that allow them to achieve their own profitability expectations our sales and results of operations will suffer during 2018 our 25 largest customers accounted for 47 of our sales and the largest customer across all end use categories accounted for 9 to 12 of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years loss of or a reduction in sales to our largest customer or any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results large multi national customers and increasingly middle market customers are unilaterally limiting the number of their suppliers or rationalizing the number of products that they offer to increase their margins and profitability as part of these initiatives these customers are creating core lists of suppliers and giving these core lists suppliers priority for new or modified products recently these customers are making inclusion on their core lists contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms including rebates which could adversely affect our margins we must either offer competitive cost in use solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these core lists or seek to manage the relationship without being on the core list if we chose not to pursue core list status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain core list status our ability to maintain our share of the customers future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations furthermore consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength these and other profitability initiatives being pursued by our customers reduce the market opportunity for which we compete and subject the volume and pricing of the remaining suppliers to downward pressure to be successful in this competitive environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers needs deliver products that contribute to our customers profitability and provide effective customer service we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers needs which may adversely affect our results of operations our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our vision 2020 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers needs and ultimately appeal to consumers innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules new and 15expanded delivery systems and other technologies we currently spend approximately 8 of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers specifications are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur r d costs to the time that these r d costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we win a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product the level of promotional support for the launch poor performance of our third party vendors anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by competitors a disruption in our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results as a company engaged in the global development manufacture and distribution of products we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes product quality control issues safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control while we operate research and development manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our r d or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins operating results and future growth a disruption in our supply chain including the inability to obtain ingredients and raw materials from third parties could adversely affect our business and financial results in connection with our manufacture of our fragrance and flavor compounds we often rely on third party suppliers for ingredients and raw materials that are integral to our manufacture of such compounds our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather climate change growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control our natural products and ingredients may also be subject to import alerts or specific country regulations that would impair our ability to obtain sufficient quantity at the relevant manufacturing facility in addition our ingredient suppliers similar to us are subject to the risks inherent in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety and environmental compliance issues licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which they have no control these suppliers also could become insolvent or experience other financial distress for example a fire at the manufacturing facility of basf group basf one of our suppliers in 2017 caused them to declare a force majeure and has resulted in a disruption of the availability of certain ingredients used in some of our fragrance and flavor compounds if our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials however for certain of our raw ingredients and raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives if we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost we would seek to i reformulate our compounds and or ii increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost however if we are not able to successfully implement any of these alternatives we could experience disruptions in production increased cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin or reduced sales if our competitors were able to more successfully adjust to such market disruption such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleum based chemicals historically we have experienced a considerable amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases and we expect this volatility to continue in the near future for example during and in 2018 we experienced increases in the prices of certain naturals including citrus in addition because frutarom s number of natural product offerings is substantial this risk may be exacerbated availability and pricing of these natural products can be impacted by crop size and quality weather climate change alternative land use and other factors which we cannot control 16if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our flavor or fragrance compounds or natural ingredient products to offset raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in long term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse long term impact on our results of operations to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards including those regarding product safety quality efficacy and environmental impact we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies or contractually by our customers including requirements concerning product safety quality and efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar issues we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process non compliance gaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers can result in products that do not meet our quality control standards or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with these standards and requirements products that are mislabeled contaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory non compliance event or even a product recall by the fda or a similar foreign agency our contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product non compliance event including penalties costs and settlements arising from litigation remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are used in many products intended for human use or consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity negative effects on consumer s health recalls and potential consumer litigation in addition if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties or if insurance or indemnification is not available the liability relating to product or possible third party claims arising from mislabeled contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore adverse publicity about our products or our customers products that contain our ingredients including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation the interruption or failure of key information technology systems or a loss of data malicious attack or other breach of security of our information technology systems may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business subject us to increased operating costs damage our reputation and expose us to litigation we rely on information technology systems including some managed by third party providers to conduct business and support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory tax or legal requirements and collecting and storing customer supplier employee and other stakeholder information the frutarom acquisition may also pose additional burden on our information technology systems as we integrate our information and financial systems into our newly acquired facilities these systems may be susceptible to disruptions or outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures natural disasters cyber attacks failed upgrades or other similar events or due to the poor performance of third party 17providers an effective response to disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our employees and third party providers to avoid any adverse impact to our business in addition our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses cybercrime computer hacking and similar information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release or misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our business including but not limited to the trade secrets upon which we rely to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations employees or customers and disrupt our operations depending on their nature and scope these threats could potentially lead to improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data or product non compliance the occurrence of any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our sales subject us to increased operating costs damage our reputation and expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings increasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry and if we are unable to react in a timely and cost effective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected we must continually anticipate and react in a timely and cost effective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency with respect to product ingredients consumers especially in developed economies such as the u s and western europe are shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to all natural healthier alternatives in addition there has been a growing demand by consumers non governmental organizations and to a lesser extent governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand including by voluntarily providing product specific ingredients disclosure these two trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and cost effective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully establish and manage collaborations joint ventures or partnerships that lead to development or commercialization of products it could adversely affect our growth from time to time we evaluate and enter into collaborations joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts or expand our materials portfolio or technology the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult and time consuming to negotiate document and implement we may not be able to successfully negotiate these arrangements or the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated furthermore our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all in addition from time to time frutarom has acquired and we intend to continue to acquire only a majority interest in companies and providing earnouts for the former owners and the ability for us to acquire the minority interests at a future date at an established price these investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors if we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and majority investments it could adversely affect our future growth we have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets which exposes us to certain risks as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets with our combination with frutarom who also had a significant presence in emerging markets our business in these markets has meaningfully grown in addition to the currency and international risks described below our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly as a result decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy further there is no assurance that our existing products variants of our existing products or new products that we make manufacture distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market due to local or global competition product price cultural differences consumer preferences or otherwise in addition emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade customs and tax regimes in these markets if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging 18markets effectively operate or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations we have significant operations outside the us the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into u s dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the u s dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future for example as of july 1 2018 we concluded that argentina s economy is highly inflationary under us gaap as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a three year period while our current operations in argentina represent less than 3 of our consolidated net sales and less than 1 of our consolidated total assets continuing inflation in argentina could adversely affect our profitability in a specific period with our increased operations in emerging markets arising from our frutarom acquisition these risks will become exacerbated changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the u s dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets and or liabilities additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected our international operations are subject to regulatory political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues cash flows or financial position we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the us europe africa the middle east latin america israel and greater asia during 2018 75 of our net sales and as a result of our acquisition of frutarom 80 of our combined net sales were to customers outside the u s and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by location include the following governmental laws regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions such as increases in taxes austerity measures that may impact consumer spending monetary policies that may impact inflation rates currency fluctuations and sustainability of resources changes in environmental health and safety regulations such as the continued implementation of the european union s reach regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations increased environmental health and safety regulations or the loss of necessary environmental permits in certain countries arising from growing consumer sensitivity concerning the inclusion of flavor additives in food products and the fact that regulators perceive nutraceuticals medical food and functional food products as having medicinal attributes the imposition of or changes in tariffs quotas trade barriers other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements by the u s or other countries which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our flavors and fragrance products to surrounding markets risks and costs arising from language and cultural differences changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate including the risk of expropriation or nationalization and the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries risks and costs associated with political and economic instability bribery and corruption anti american sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel natural disasters pandemics or international conflicts including terrorist acts or national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate which could interrupt our operations or endanger our personnel or the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights 19the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations economic uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth our flavors and fragrance compounds and our fragrance cosmetic active and functional food ingredients are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world historically demand for consumer products using these compounds and ingredients was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs population growth an expanding global middle class and general economic growth especially in emerging markets the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the predictions surrounding the global recessionary economic environment in europe has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase inflation or result in other market wide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets in addition growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances compounds or ingredients or order cancellations the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers discretion customers may cancel reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice significant cancellations reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results it is currently anticipated that these challenging economic uncertainties will continue to affect certain of our markets during 2019 which could adversely affect our sales profitability and overall operating results our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers scientists and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace furthermore as we continue to focus on innovation our need for scientists and other professionals will increase an important factor in our ability to realize our anticipated benefits from the frutarom acquisition is our ability to retain key employees at frutarom the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy competition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and reward the acquired frutarom employees or our current employees in our combined company we may not be able to retain them however if we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels and expose us to civil or criminal liability which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth our business operations and properties make use of manufacture sell and distribute substances that are sometimes considered hazardous and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment including air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and clean up of existing environmental contamination failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities administrative civil and criminal penalties liability for damages and negative publicity if we are unable to meet production requirements we can lose customer orders which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply for example in 2015 chinese authorities notified us of compliance issues pertaining to the emission of odors from several of our plants in china and consequently we invested approximately 6 5 million in odor abatement equipment at these facilities and have built a second flavors manufacturing facility in china with an estimated cost of 45 million we have also recently completed negotiations with the chinese government concerning the relocation of a second fragrance facility in china idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated if these non compliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations close a plant or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected 20our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies as part of our ongoing strategy we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs for example we are in the process of relocating one of our fragrance ingredients facilities in china constructing new facilities in india and indonesia and other capital projects required to integrate our recently acquired frutarom business the spending associated with these projects may result in capital spending above previous expectations which could adversely affect our cash flows in addition an integral component of our synergy strategy for the frutarom acquisition is focused on rationalizing the aggregate number of sites that the combined company operates our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and synergies from these activities may be affected by various factors and may pose significant risks including the risk that we may be unable to successfully and efficiently manufacture the relocated product lines at a different manufacturing facility the risk that we may be unable to effectively reduce overhead and integrate and retain employees of the relocated operations the risk that we may face difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards controls procedures policies and information systems the risk that we may face integrating newly acquired manufacturing distribution and technology facilities potential strains on our personnel systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities and unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the relocated operations furthermore actual charges costs and adjustments due to these activities may vary materially from our estimates and these activities may require cash and non cash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory and or working capital balances we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our product sales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product sales mix to meet our customers demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected we sell certain accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under factoring agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends we could be adversely affected by violations of the u s foreign corrupt practices act or similar u s or foreign anti bribery and anti corruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate the global nature of our business the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations the u s foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar anti bribery and anti corruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage in addition u s public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa u s companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees 21agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the u s and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions such as china india brazil russia and africa which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues in certain jurisdictions compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices from time to time we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances control testing and compliance reviews and take remedial actions when appropriate to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations in addition frutarom grew through rapid acquisition and as part of our integration efforts we will be seeking to implement our anti corruption and similar policies throughout a number of those acquired companies many of which were not previously subject to these u s laws detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or similar laws is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any allegations of non compliance with the fcpa or similar laws could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction over the near term including interruptions of business or loss of third party relationships which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar laws could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions significant fines termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as well as our extract methodologies and processes for our nutraceutical natural colors for food and natural antioxidants for food protection as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third party assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation or other claims any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims regulatory investigations and litigation including claims related to intellectual property product liability environmental matters and indirect taxes for instance product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply flavors and fragrances to the food and beverage functional food pharma nutraceutical and personal care industries our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims and regulatory investigations in addition as we expand our product offering into functional food nutraceuticals and natural antioxidants we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims in the u s europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products these claims can arise as a result of function claims health claims nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest therapeutic benefits for certain foods or food 22components the cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our profitability and our results of operations as a result of the acquisition of frutarom we assumed a number of legal claims regulatory investigations and litigation and we may become involved in additional actions in the future arising from the acquired operations specifically as frutarom has a significantly greater number of facilities that are located globally and a significantly larger number of customers our exposure to these type of environmental claims product liability claims and regulatory investigations may increase this could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices any of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations our funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the long term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements any future impairment of our tangible or intangible long lived assets may adversely impact our profitability a significant portion of our assets consists of long lived assets including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities and intangible assets and goodwill as a result of numerous recent acquisitions including the 2018 acquisition of frutarom as of december 31 2018 we had recorded approximately 8 4 billion of intangible assets and goodwill including goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions after the frutarom acquisition was completed for instance we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements long lived assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable for example the amount of goodwill that we recorded from the frutarom acquisition could be subject to impairment based upon future adverse changes in our business or prospects including our inability to recognize the benefits anticipated by the transaction additionally goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually indicators such as under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results changes in our strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets unexpected negative industry or economic trends decreased market capitalization relative to net book values unanticipated competitive activities change in consumer demand loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired to the extent any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated whether due to internal or external factors the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our long lived assets including intangible assets or goodwill occur changes in our tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results we are subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of 23taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential non compliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where non compliance is determined however governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and if challenged we may not prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made in addition a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multi national companies and in the european union the tax policies of certain european union member states one of these efforts has been led by the organisation for economic co operation and development an international association of 34 countries including the u s which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax transfer pricing and tax treaty provisions in member countries since 2013 the european commission ec has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of european union member states with respect to specific multi national corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with european union rules on state aid as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain european union member states under european union law selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions the tax authorities of the affected european union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling in late 2015 and early 2016 the ec declared that tax rulings related to other companies by tax authorities in luxembourg the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the european union state aid restrictions if the ec were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities the recently adopted u s tax legislation may result in additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results and profitability on december 22 2017 the u s government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act that significantly revised the u s tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2018 and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods in future periods we expect that our effective tax rate will be impacted by the lower u s corporate tax rate that will initially be offset by the elimination of the deductibility of performance based incentive compensation and other provisions of the tax act that may impact us prospectively however the ultimate impact of the tax act will depend on additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the tax act and any operating and structural changes that we may undertake to permit us to benefit from the new lower u s tax rate prospectively this could adversely affect our results of operations the potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations as part of our ingredients research program we seek to enhance our collaboration with research institutions and companies throughout the world including biotechnology companies however it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product the manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations as prescribed by the food and drug administration and the applicable standards prescribed by european commission and the competent authorities of european union member states and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our competitors products this may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results our business may be negatively impacted as a result of the united kingdom s expected departure from the european union in 2019 24we currently manufacture goods in the united kingdom for distribution in the european union and vice versa and therefore may be adversely affected as a result of the united kingdom s expected departure from the european union in 2019 the united kingdom is expected to withdraw from the european union in march 2019 commonly referred to as brexit negotiations are still underway to determine the terms of the united kingdom s withdrawal from the european union the progress and outcomes of brexit negotiations have and may continue to create global economic uncertainty especially as customers and potential customers are unable to currently gauge the future regulations and therefore costs that will apply to their operations in the united kingdom and between the united kingdom and the european union the withdrawal could among other outcomes exacerbate the disruption of the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union or other nations as the united kingdom pursues independent trade relations in addition brexit has caused legal uncertainty which could last indefinitely and may potentially create divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the united kingdom makes to retain access to european union or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union would have and how such withdrawal would affect us adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the cross border agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future \n",

      "item 1a risk factors risks related to our business generally risks related to global economic and market conditions global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the u s and or global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere adverse market conditions including unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading broad trends in business and finance consolidation or contraction in the number of market participants actual or threatened acts of war or terrorism or other armed hostilities actual or threatened trade war including between the united states and china or other governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or trade policies concerns over inflation and weakening consumer confidence levels the availability of cash for investment by mutual funds exchange traded funds and other wholesale and retail investors the level and volatility of interest rates the difference between the yields on corporate securities being traded and those on related benchmark securities and foreign currency exchange rates the effect of federal reserve board monetary policy increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions and other regulatory requirements and political impasses credit availability and other liquidity concerns concerns over credit default or bankruptcy of one or more sovereign nations or corporate entities and legislative and regulatory changes including changes to financial industry regulations and tax laws there have been significant declines in trading volumes in the financial markets generally in the past and there may be similar declines in trading volumes generally or across our platforms in particular in the future any one or more of the above factors may contribute to reduced trading volumes our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the u s and global financial markets the u k exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects the u k ceased to be a member of the e u on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as brexit triggering a period during which the u k will continue to observe applicable e u regulations through december 31 2020 or any later extension date the transition period based upon the current state of the negotiations between the u k and e u we expect that regulated financial services firms including our u k subsidiaries will lose their passporting rights to automatically operate throughout the e u following the transition period this future loss of the existing passport right to the e u will affect us and many of our clients for us it means that we will have to rely on our dutch regulated subsidiaries to provide our trading platforms and certain post trade services to our clients in the e u 23 brexit has significantly affected the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape in both the u k and e u and could have a material impact on their economies and the future growth of various industries in particular the ecosystem of the e u financial services industry in which we operate which prior to brexit has been heavily centered in london has become more decentralized the exit of the u k has significantly impacted the business environment in which we and our clients operate increased the cost of conducting business in both the e u and the u k and introduces significant new uncertainties with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our clients are subject as we have historically conducted business in europe primarily through our u k subsidiaries we have new regulatory and operational costs and challenges associated with the establishment of our subsidiaries in the netherlands and the management of a less centralized customer and employee base we could also be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater volatility in the pound sterling and the u k economy brexit is expected to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u k determines which e u laws to replace or replicate which may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject in addition the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes could increase following brexit brexit has also required us to make changes to the technology underlying our trading platforms and regulatory reporting systems in the u k and e u which has resulted in new regulatory and operational costs and challenges changes to u k immigration policy will also occur as a result of brexit and our access to and our ability to compete for and hire skilled employees in both the u k and the e u is expected to become more constrained although it is not possible at this point in time to predict fully the effects of the exit of the u k from the e u any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations risks related to operating in the electronic fixed income trading markets decreases in trading volumes in the fixed income markets generally or on our platforms would harm our business and profitability we have experienced significant decreases in overall market volumes in the past and may experience similar decreases in market volumes in the future declines in the overall volume of fixed income securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platforms and fees generated from related activities likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixed income trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platforms and consequently lower commissions and revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with broker dealers in addition during rapidly moving markets broker dealers are less likely to post prices electronically our market share of the fixed income trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt the level of bond fund inflows or outflows the percentage of volumes comprised of rule 144a transactions the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as block trades the level of credit spreads and credit volatility and whether the prevalent market environment is an offer wanted or bid wanted environment a decline in overall market volumes trading volumes on our platforms or in our platforms market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the industry in which we operate is rapidly evolving if we are unable to adapt our business effectively to keep pace with industry changes we may not be able to compete effectively which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the electronic financial services industry is characterized by rapidly changing and increasingly complex technologies and systems changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands including access to new technologies and markets frequent technology and service introductions evolving industry standards changing regulatory requirements and new business models if we are not able to keep pace with changing market conditions or client demands and if our competitors release new functionality or technology before we do our existing platforms solutions and technologies may become obsolete or our competitive position may be materially harmed each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations operating in a rapidly evolving industry involves a high degree of risk and our future success will depend in part on our ability to 24 attract and retain market participants on our platforms on a cost effective basis expand and enhance reliable and cost effective product and service offerings for our clients respond effectively to competitive pressures respond effectively to the loss of any of our significant broker dealer or institutional investor clients including due to merger consolidation bankruptcy liquidation or other cause including among other things the collection of any amounts due from such clients diversify our sources of revenues maintain adequate control of our expenses operate support expand and develop our operations technology website software communications and other systems defend our trading platforms and other systems from cybersecurity threats manage growth in personnel and operations increase awareness of our brand or market positioning expand our sales and marketing programs take advantage of acquisitions strategic alliances and other opportunities and respond to regulatory changes or demands if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platforms new services and or service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platforms for example we have responded to the reduction in fixed income secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by among other things introducing a number of all to all trading options for our institutional investor and broker dealer clients the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platforms may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide we cannot assure you that any new features and versions will become or remain successful if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and cost effective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations risks related to competition we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance the fixed income securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future within our markets we compete based on our ability to provide our clients with deep liquidity a broad network of market participants a wide range of products and protocols and comprehensive pre trade trade and post trade functionality as well as the reliability security and ease of use of our electronic platforms and solutions among other factors we primarily compete with other electronic trading platforms and trading businesses conducted directly between broker dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone email or instant messaging our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include other multi party electronic trading platforms market data and information vendors securities and futures exchanges inter dealer brokerage firms 25 technology software and information services or other companies that have existing commercial relationships with broker dealers or institutional investors and other approved regulatory mechanisms many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixed income or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and client requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified due to consolidation which has resulted in increasingly large and sophisticated competitors in recent years our competitors have made acquisitions and or entered into joint ventures and consortia to improve the competitiveness of their electronic trading offerings if as a result of industry consolidation our competitors are able to offer lower cost and or a wider range of trading venues and solutions obtain more favorable terms from third party providers or otherwise take actions that could increase their market share our competitive position and therefore our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected our operations also include the sale of pre and post trade services analytics and market data there is a high degree of competition among market data and information vendors in solutions for pre and post trade data analytics and reporting and such businesses may become more competitive in the future as new competitors emerge some of these companies are already in or may enter the electronic trading business accordingly some of our competitors may be able to combine use of their electronic trading platforms with complementary access to market data and analytical tools and or leverage relationships with existing clients to obtain additional business from such clients which could preempt use of our platforms or solutions for example bloomberg refinitiv and ice own trading platforms that compete with ours and also have a data and analytics relationships with the vast majority of institutional wholesale and retail market participants if we are not able to compete successfully in this area in the future our revenues could be adversely impacted and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected risks related to our future levels of business profitability and growth neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of market participants that use our electronic trading platforms our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platforms by these participants for a wide range of fixed income products and trade sizes individuals at broker dealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platforms we cannot assure you that the growth of electronic means of trading securities that we have experienced in recent years will continue our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 48 1 of our revenues from secondary trading in u s high grade corporate bonds our long term business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixed income products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability in recent years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our broker dealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 26 in addition under certain of our fee plans our fees are designated in basis points in yield and as a result are subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded or our fees vary based on trade size or maturity we anticipate that our average fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield years to maturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including the unpredictability of the financial services industry difficulty in quickly adjusting our expense base if revenues fall short of expectations our ability to retain existing broker dealer and institutional investor clients and attract new broker dealer and institutional investor clients our ability to drive an increase in the use of our electronic trading platforms by new and existing broker dealer and institutional investor clients changes in our fee plans the introduction of new features on our electronic trading platforms the effectiveness of our sales force new product and service introductions by us or our competitors fluctuations in overall market trading volume or our market share for our key products technical difficulties or interruptions in our service general economic conditions in our geographic markets additional investment in our services or operations and new regulations that limit or affect how our electronic trading platforms can operate or which increase our regulatory compliance costs as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis as has occurred in the past which could result in decreases in our stock price as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platforms to enter new markets including new asset classes products and geographies including markets where we have little or no operating experience we may have difficulties identifying and entering into new markets due to established competitors lack of recognition of our brand and lack of acceptance of our platforms and solutions as has occurred with certain of our initiatives in the past expansion particularly in new geographic markets may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time in particular we may need to make additional investments in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems furthermore our expansion efforts may divert management s attention or inefficiently utilize our resources if we are not able to manage our expansion effectively our expansion costs could increase at a faster rate than our revenues from these new markets if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage our expansion our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in any new markets even if we do adapt our products services and technologies we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients to our platforms and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock 27 risks related to our geographic and customer concentration our businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by an adverse change in the regions in which we operate historically our business operations have been substantially located in the u s and the u k while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas we are still highly concentrated in these areas accordingly our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these two countries such as brexit moreover due to the concentration of our operations in these areas such operations are less diversified and accordingly are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors if we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected we are dependent on our broker dealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or third party platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients we rely on our broker dealer clients to provide liquidity on our electronic trading platforms by posting prices for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our broker dealer clients to us are minimal non exclusive and terminable by such clients our broker dealer clients buy and sell fixed income securities through traditional methods including by telephone and e mail messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our broker dealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and many of our broker dealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants and or as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such broker dealers primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors if bank affiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our operating results in the u s the volcker rule section of the dodd frank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bank affiliated broker dealer clients ability to make markets in a variety of fixed income securities in addition over the past several years there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries and several of our large broker dealer clients have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixed income products further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by our broker dealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platforms and increasingly to provide liquidity through our open trading protocols a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal non exclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients also buy and sell fixed income securities through traditional methods including by telephone e mail and instant messaging and through other electronic trading platforms there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of a major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations credit and market risks we are exposed to risks in connection with certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary in connection with our anonymous trading protocols we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a third party clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 28 we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to the clients on our platforms including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise that involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade the settlement of the trade or claims that we resolved an error trade dispute incorrectly or that a system malfunction or delay caused monetary loss to a client in addition because of the ease and speed with which trades can be executed on our electronic platforms clients can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade instructions or by entering trade orders inaccurately a significant error trade or a large number of error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade on our platforms although we maintain error trade policies designed to protect our anonymous trading participants and enable us to manage the risks attendant in acting as a matched principal counterparty depending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are required to hold a securities position as a result of an error there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading protocols and our acquisition of liquidityedge we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete up to date or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks self clearing will expose us to significant operational financial and liquidity risks we intend to begin self clearing substantially all of our bond transactions for our u s operations in the first half of 2020 and we may expand self clearing to our foreign operations in the future self clearing requires us to finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations self clearing exposes our business to operational risks including business and technology disruption operational inefficiencies liquidity and financing risks and potentially increased expenses we may encounter difficulties that may lead to operating inefficiencies including technology issues dissatisfaction amongst our client base disruption in the infrastructure that supports the business inadequate liquidity increased margin requirements with clearing organizations and third party settlement agents who provide financing with respect to transactions reductions in available borrowing capacity and financial loss any such delay disruption expense or failure could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk moreover any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail the fixed income products that can be traded through our open trading functionality as well as our investments in fixed and variable rate debt financial instruments are subject to significant interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks to manage these and the risks inherent in our business we must maintain effective policies procedures and systems that enable us to identify monitor and control our exposure to financial legal regulatory operational and market risks our risk management methods are based on internally developed controls observed historical market behavior and what we believe to be industry practices our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective because of their design their implementation or the lack of adequate accurate or timely information our risk management methods may also fail to identify a risk or understand a risk that might result in losses if our risk management policies and efforts are ineffective we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results we must rely upon our analysis of information regarding markets personnel clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete up to date or properly analyzed furthermore we rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and potential failure the challenges of which are exacerbated by the 24 hour a day global nature of our business 29 our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory operational and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed technology and it systems risks rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our broker dealer and institutional investor clients we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platforms may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop and or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our broker dealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients continue to attract highly skilled technology personnel and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis developing our electronic trading platforms and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platforms information databases and network infrastructure to broker dealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our broker dealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our platforms and use those of our competitors further the adoption of new internet networking telecommunications or blockchain technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transaction processing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements we depend on third party suppliers for key products and services we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient cost effective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in particular we depend on third party vendors for our bond reference databases the clearing and settlement of our open trading transactions and to provide the technology underpinning our u s treasury platform we obtain essential reference data and information services from external sources including data received from certain competitors clients self regulatory organizations and other third party data providers our reference data sources and information providers could increase the price for or withdraw their data or information services for a variety of reasons further as has occurred in the past our competitors could revise the current terms on which they provide us with data or information services or could cease providing us with data or information services altogether for a variety of reasons including competition disruptions in the services provided by those third parties to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide technology services that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 30 we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud computing and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other third party services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships has in the past had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our third party service providers these contracts usually have multi year terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology our success depends on maintaining the integrity and capacity of our electronic trading platforms systems and infrastructure in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure real time access to our electronic trading platforms for our clients if our trading platforms cannot cope or expand to cope with demand or otherwise fail to perform we could experience disruptions in service slow delivery times and insufficient capacity these consequences could result in our clients deciding to stop using or reduce their use of our platforms which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to continually improve and upgrade our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platforms technology and systems to the requirements of our broker dealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platforms to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business systems failures interruptions delays in service catastrophic events and resulting interruptions in the availability of our trading platforms could materially harm our business and reputation our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our trading platforms systems networks and infrastructure we cannot assure you that we or our third party providers will not experience systems failures or business interruptions as has occurred in the past our systems networks infrastructure and other operations in particular our trading platforms are vulnerable to impact or interruption from a wide variety of causes including irregular or heavy use of our trading platforms during peak trading times or at times of increased market volatility power internet or telecommunications failures hardware failures or software errors human error acts of vandalism or sabotage catastrophic events such as natural disasters extreme weather events or acts of war or terrorism malicious cyberattacks or cyber incidents such as unauthorized access ransomware loss or destruction of data computer viruses or other malicious code and the loss or failure of systems over which we have no control such as loss of support services from critical third party providers in addition we may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity and or increased costs associated with such usage 31 any failure of or significant interruption delay or disruption to or security breaches affecting our systems networks or infrastructure has in the past and could in the future result in disruption to our operations including disruptions in service to our clients slower response times distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades delays in trade execution incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades significant expense to repair replace or remediate systems networks or infrastructure financial losses and liabilities to clients loss of clients legal or regulatory claims proceedings penalties or fines any system failure or significant interruption delay or disruption in our operations or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our platforms we internally support and maintain many of our systems and networks including those underlying our trading platforms however we may not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all systems networks or infrastructure problems our failure to monitor or maintain our systems networks and infrastructure including those maintained or supported by our third party providers or to find a replacement for defective or obsolete components within our systems networks and infrastructure in a timely and cost effective manner when necessary would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we generally have disaster recovery and business continuity plans that utilize industry standards and best practices for much of our business including redundant systems networks computer software and hardware and data centers to address interruption to our normal course of business our systems networks and infrastructure may not always be fully redundant and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not always be sufficient or effective similarly although some contracts with our third party providers such as our hosting facility providers require adequate disaster recovery or business continuity capabilities we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly our disaster recovery and business continuity plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation if we are unable to execute our disaster recovery and business continuity plans or if our plans prove insufficient for a particular situation or take longer than expected to implement in a crisis situation it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur if we experience design defects errors failures or delays with our platforms products or services including our auto execution technology and pricing algorithms our business could suffer serious harm our platforms products and services including our auto execution technology and pricing algorithms may and have from time to time contained design defects and errors when first introduced or when new updates or enhancements are released in our development of new protocols platform features and updates and enhancements to our existing platforms products and services including our auto execution technology and pricing algorithms we may make a design error that causes the platform protocol or feature to operate incorrectly or less effectively many of our protocols also rely on data and services provided by third party providers over which we have limited or no control and may be provided to us with defects errors or failures our clients may also use our platforms products or services together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem if design defects errors or failures are discovered in our current or future platforms or protocols we may not be able to correct or work around them in a cost effective or timely manner or at all the existence of design defects errors failures or delays that are significant or are perceived to be significant could also result in rejection or delay in market acceptance of our platform or protocols damage to our reputation loss of clients and related revenues diversion of resources product liability claims regulatory actions or increases in costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 32 cybersecurity risks malicious cyber attacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties the operation of our electronic trading platforms relies on the secure processing storage and transmission of a large amount of transactional data and other confidential sensitive data including confidential client and personal information our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential and personal customer information unavailability or disruption of service computer viruses acts of vandalism or other malicious code cyber attack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact despite the defensive measures we have taken we are and will continue to be subject to attacks which may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as infrastructure support providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential or personal information our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures our business also depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our platforms systems networks and infrastructure any failure of or significant interruption delay or disruption to our systems networks or infrastructure due to a cyber attack could result in disruption to our operations including disruptions in service to our clients slower response times distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades delays in trade execution incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades significant expense to repair replace or remediate systems networks or infrastructure financial losses and liabilities to clients loss of clients legal or regulatory claims proceedings penalties or fines we also face the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints of any of the third party service providers that facilitate our business activities including clients clearing agents and trading system software network or data providers such parties could also be the source of a cyber attack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure any system failure or significant interruption delay or disruption in our operations or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our trading platform there have been an increasing number of cyber attacks in recent years in various industries including ours and cyber security risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators our regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats including the assessment of firms vulnerability to cyber attacks in particular regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies practices and procedures protecting firm networks and information identifying and addressing risks associated with clients vendors and other third parties preventing and detecting unauthorized activities adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches and establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platforms we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any misappropriated confidential or personal information although we intend to continue to implement industry standard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 33 intellectual property risks we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future functionalities products or services this could adversely affect our ability to compete intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements third party non disclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology and or business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if our efforts to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our technology pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could be expensive and time consuming to defend prevent us from operating our business or portions of our business cause us to cease developing licensing or using all or any part of our electronic trading platform that incorporates the challenged intellectual property require us to redesign our products or services which may not be feasible result in significant monetary liability divert management s attention and resources and require us to pay royalties or enter into licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us as they have done in the past with respect to our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 34 risks related to possible transactions or investments if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions from time to time we may consider acquisitions which may not be completed or if completed may not be as beneficial to us as expected we have made acquisitions in the past including the purchase of xtrakter in 2013 and liquidityedge in 2019 we also may consider potential divestitures of businesses from time to time we routinely evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis however even if we execute a definitive agreement there can be no assurance that we will consummate the transaction within the anticipated closing timeframe or at all moreover there is significant competition for acquisition and expansion opportunities in the electronic financial services industry if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks including we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further our business strategy or that we overpaid for the company or assets or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision may change we may have difficulty integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing electronic trading platform products and services we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business or retaining the key personnel of the acquired business there may be client confusion if our services overlap with those of the acquired company and we may have difficulty retaining key customers vendors and other business partners of the acquired business our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises entry into markets in which we have limited experience and where competitors hold stronger market positions potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or product and exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition including but not limited to claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as out of pocket costs the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large one time write offs such as of acquired in process research and development costs and restructuring charges if we enter into strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures we may not realize the anticipated strategic goals for any such transactions from time to time we may enter into strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures as a means to accelerate our entry into new markets provide new solutions or enhance our existing capabilities entering into strategic alliances partnerships and joint ventures entails risks including i difficulties in developing or expanding the business of newly formed alliances partnerships and joint ventures ii exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest iii potential conflicts with or among our partners iv the possibility that our partners could take action without our approval or prevent us from taking action and v the possibility that our partners become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations 35 in addition there may be a long negotiation period before we enter into a strategic alliance partnership or joint venture or a long preparation period before we commence providing the intended product or solution and or begin earning revenues pursuant to such arrangement we typically incur significant business development expenses and management s attention may be diverted from the operation of our existing business during the discussion and negotiation period with no guarantee of consummation of the proposed transaction even if we succeed in developing a strategic alliance partnership or joint venture with a new partner we may not be successful in maintaining the relationship which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures on terms that are favorable to us or at all or that any strategic alliance partnership or joint ventures we have entered into or may enter into will be successful in particular these arrangements may not generate the expected number of new clients or increased trading volume or other benefits we seek unsuccessful strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures or those that do not fully meet our expectations could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at year end or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgement which requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges risks related to key personnel and employees we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of non vested equity compensation awards we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel although we have invested in succession plans and we have short term contingency plans in place any loss or interruption of mr mcvey s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively and or pursue our business strategy because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business we strive to provide high quality services that will allow us to establish and maintain long term relationships with our clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internet related services product managers and senior sales executives the market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of fixed income products many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff additionally highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet high technology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stock based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 36 regulatory risks we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the u k the afm in the netherlands the swiss financial market supervisory authority in switzerland the monetary authority of singapore the hong kong securities and futures commission the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil in addition xtrakter is registered as an arm and apa with the fca and the afm as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction non compliance with their laws rules and regulations most aspects of our broker dealer and other licensed subsidiaries are highly regulated including the way we deal with our clients our capital requirements our financial and regulatory reporting practices required record keeping and record retention procedures the licensing of our employees and the conduct of our directors officers employees and affiliates we cannot assure you that we and or our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines cease and desist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a broker dealer certain of our regulated subsidiaries including our registered broker dealers and mtf are subject to u s or foreign regulations which prohibit repayment of borrowings from us or our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation is registered with the cftc as a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year our ability to operate our platform in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely or cost effective basis or at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see item 1 business government regulation 37 some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary which may include changes in control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business our business and the business of many of our clients is subject to extensive regulation governmental and regulatory authorities periodically review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may promulgate new or revised or adopt changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing rules and regulations at any time any such changes in laws rules or regulations or in governmental policies could create additional regulatory exposure for our business cause us to incur significant additional costs require us to change or cease aspects of our business or restrict or limit our ability to grow our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations there have been in the past and could be in the future significant technological operational and compliance costs associated with the obligations that derive from compliance with evolving laws rules and regulations changes in legislation and in the rules and regulations promulgated by domestic and foreign regulators and how they are applied often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of dealers and other financial services intermediaries including our dealer clients and could result in restrictions in the way we and our clients conduct business for example various rules promulgated since the financial crisis including under the dodd frank act could adversely affect our dealer clients ability to make markets in a variety of products thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform our business and that of our clients could also be affected by the monetary policies adopted by the federal reserve and foreign central banking authorities which may affect the credit quality of our clients or increase the cost for our clients to trade certain instruments on our trading platform in addition such changes in monetary policy may directly impact our cost of funds for financing and investment activities and may impact the value of the financial instruments we hold in addition regulatory bodies in europe have recently developed new rules and regulations targeted at the financial services industry including mifid ii and mifir which were implemented in january 2018 and which introduced significant changes to the e u financial markets designed to facilitate more efficient markets and greater transparency for participants mifid ii and mifir may have an adverse effect on our operations and our ability to offer our trading platforms in a manner that can successfully compete against other methods of trading additionally most of the world s major economies have introduced and continue to introduce regulations implementing basel iii a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy stress testing and market liquidity risk the continued implementation of these and other bank capital standards could restrict the ability of our large bank and dealer customers to raise additional capital or use existing capital for trading purposes which might cause them to trade less on our trading platforms and diminish transaction velocity in addition as regulations are introduced which affect our prudential obligations the regulatory capital requirements imposed on certain of our subsidiaries may change we believe that it remains premature to know conclusively how specific aspects of the regulatory developments described above may directly affect our business we cannot predict whether additional changes to the laws rules and regulations that govern our business and operations including changes to their interpretation implementation or enforcement will occur in the future or the extent to which any such changes will impact our business and operations in addition we cannot predict how current proposals that have not yet been finalized and or that remain subject to ongoing debate will be implemented or in what form we believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new laws rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact additionally unintended consequences of such new laws rules and regulations may adversely affect our industry our clients and us in ways yet to be determined any such legal and regulatory changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws regulations and obligations could harm our business certain types of information we collect compile store use transfer and or publish are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and information security these laws and regulations govern the storing sharing use processing transfer disclosure and protection of personal information and other content the scope of these laws and regulations are changing subject to differing interpretations may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules we are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and obligations to third parties related to applicable privacy data protection and information security 38 the regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is uncertain and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future and we expect that there will continue to be new laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security proposed and enacted in the various jurisdictions in which we operate for example european legislators adopted the general data protection regulations gdpr that became effective in may 2018 the gdpr imposes more stringent e u data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance further brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the u k in particular it is unclear whether the u k will enact data protection laws or regulations designed to be consistent with the gdpr and how data transfers to and from the u k will be regulated our efforts to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws and regulations could entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and could impact our ability to provide certain solutions additionally if our third party providers violate any of these laws or regulations such violations may also put our operations at risk any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any of our obligations relating to privacy data protection or information security may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions litigation claims or negative publicity and could result in significant liability increased costs or cause our clients to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business the extensive regulation of our business means we have ongoing exposure to potentially significant costs and penalties our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and self regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including u s and non u s government agencies and self regulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the u s are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion self regulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association nfa along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorney generals in the u s and the fca in the u k and other international regulators have increased accordingly accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results legal risks in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm misconduct or error by employees could include engaging in improperly using our confidential information or the confidential or personal information of our clients or engaging in improper or unauthorized activities or transactions our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients have in the past and may in the future make claims against us regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades resolution of trade error claims system failures failure to protect their confidential or personal information mismanagement or even fraud we may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and the services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 39 risks related to growing our u s and international operations we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future we operate electronic trading platforms in europe latin america and asia and we may further expand our operations throughout these and other regions we have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platform and services however there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include difficulty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for planned expansion if at all and the possibility that any approvals that are obtained may impose restrictions on the operation of our business the inability to manage and coordinate the various regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving and subject to unexpected change difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations less developed technological infrastructures and generally higher costs which could result in lower client acceptance of our services or clients having difficulty accessing our trading platforms fluctuations in exchange rates reduced or no protection for intellectual property rights seasonal reductions in business activity and potentially adverse tax consequences our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business for example mifid ii and mifir were implemented by regulatory bodies in europe in january 2018 we cannot predict the full extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our european business and operations but they may cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure brexit could lead to further legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u k determines which e u laws to replace or replicate our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and time consuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients trading activities on our platform we cannot predict what future actions the regulatory bodies that supervise our business might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources we have significantly expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in addition we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service and the period before the product or service is successfully developed introduced and adopted may extend over many months or years even after incurring these costs our clients may determine that they do not need or prefer the product or service we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 40 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results we conduct operations in several different countries outside the u s most notably the u k and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in non u s dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in u s dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into u s dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the u s dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our net investment in our u k subsidiaries and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our non u s denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition liquidity and funding risks we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things support more rapid growth of our business develop new or enhanced services and products fund operating losses respond to competitive pressures acquire complementary companies or technologies enter into strategic alliances increase the regulatory net capital necessary to support our operations or respond to unanticipated or changing capital requirements the growth of our open trading protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us all or part of any debt financing could be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase co which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase co that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 100 0 million subject to the satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional 50 0 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things may restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants may restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 41 incur or guarantee additional debt create or incur liens change our line of business sell or transfer assets make certain investments or acquisitions pay dividends or distributions redeem or repurchase our equity or make certain other restricted payments consummate a merger or consolidation enter into certain swap derivative or similar transactions enter into certain transactions with affiliates and incur restrictions on our ability to grant liens or in the case of subsidiaries pay dividends or other distributions we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a minimum net regulatory capital balance for certain subsidiaries and a minimum consolidated adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda level we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement risks related to our internal controls as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management s attention from our business we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 sox and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us risks related to our common stock market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following the other risk factors described in this annual report on form 10 k prevailing interest rates the market for similar securities changes in the nature of our stockholder base 42 additional issuances of common stock general economic conditions and our financial condition performance and prospects including our ability or inability to meet analyst expectations most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance third party investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales we may decrease or cease paying dividends on our common stock in the future there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future or if we continue paying dividends that such dividends will be paid at the rate at which they were paid in prior periods if we were to decrease the dividend rate or cease paying dividends investors may need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the primary or only way to realize any future gains on their investment if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that prevent stockholders from calling special meetings allow the directors to amend the bylaws without stockholder approval and set forth advance notice procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition certain of our executives have severance agreements that could require an acquirer to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions 43 \n",

local and regional networks operated in many countries these networks often have the support of government influence or mandate in some cases they are owned by financial institutions these networks typically focus on debit payment products and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands examples include star nyce and pulse in the u s interac in canada eftpos in australia and mir in russia alternate payment providers these providers often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels but are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale these companies may process payments using in house account transfers between parties electronic funds transfer networks like the ach global or local networks like visa or some combination of the foregoing in some cases these entities are both a partner and a competitor to visa ach and real time payment rtp networks these networks are often governed by local regulations primarily focused on interbank transfers many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments we also compete with closed loop payment systems emerging payments networks wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers payment processors we compete with payment processors for the processing of visa transactions these processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation for example as a result of regulation in europe under the interchange fee regulation ifr we may face competition from other networks processors and other third parties who could process visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers we believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance security convenience speed and reliability offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions merchants fintechs governments non governmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions we believe visa is well positioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visa branded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet seasonality we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018 accounted for more than 30 percent of our net revenues in those years 16table of contentsworking capitalpayments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement most u s dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement in currencies other than the u s dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions government regulationas a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used the most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below for further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business see item 1a risk factors regulatory risks anti corruption anti money laundering anti terrorism and sanctions we are subject to anti corruption laws and regulations including the u s foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage we are also subject to anti money laundering and anti terrorist financing laws and regulations including the u s bank secrecy act in addition we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac in the u s therefore we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive ofac trade sanctions currently cuba iran north korea syria and crimea or that are included on ofac s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons to issue or acquire visa cards or engage in transactions using our services government imposed market participation and restrictions certain governments including china india indonesia russia thailand and vietnam have taken actions to promote domestic payments systems and or certain issuers payments networks or processors by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers impose local ownership requirements on processors require data localization or mandate domestic processing be done in that country interchange rates and fees an increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer act dodd frank act in the u s limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions the european union s eu ifr limits interchange rates in europe as discussed below and the reserve bank of australia and the central bank of brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange internet transactions many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor identify filter restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the internet such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol network exclusivity and routing in the u s the dodd frank act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangements for the debit and prepaid market segments other jurisdictions impose similar limitations such as the ifr s prohibition in europe on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card no surcharge rules we have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa products instead of other means however merchants ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation privacy and data protection aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulations which impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service in addition regulators are proposing new laws or regulations that could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data handling practices create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data 17table of contentssupervisory oversight of the payments industry visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the u s for example the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec has supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to u s financial institutions the federal banking agencies comprising the ffiec are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union administration visa also may be separately examined by the bureau of consumer financial protection as a service provider to the banks that issue visa branded consumer credit and debit card products central banks in other countries regions including europe russia ukraine and the united kingdom as discussed below have recognized or designated visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions such as brazil and hong kong european regulations and supervisory oversight visa in europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the european economic area eea visa europe is designated as a recognized payment system in the united kingdom bringing it within the scope of the bank of england s supervisory powers and subject to various requirements including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the united kingdom s financial system visa europe is also subject to the european central bank s oversight whose main focus is on the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area including the security operational reliability and business continuity of the payment systems furthermore visa europe is regulated by the united kingdom s payment systems regulator psr which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices systems rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the united kingdom and ensuring payments meet account holder needs the psr is also the regulator responsible for monitoring visa europe s compliance with the ifr in the united kingdom the ifr regulates interchange rates within europe requires visa europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting organization and decision making purposes within the eu and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing national competent authorities in the eu are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the ifr in their markets there are other regulations in the european union that impact our business as discussed above including privacy and data protection anti bribery anti money laundering anti terrorism and sanctions other recent regulatory changes in europe such as the second payment services directive psd2 require among other things that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging non financial institution players psd2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences as discussed in item 1a risk factors business risks the united kingdom s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results brexit could lead to further legal and regulatory complexity in europe additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues including mobile payment transactions tokenization access rights for non financial institutions money transfer identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us furthermore following the passage of psd2 in europe several countries including australia brazil canada hong kong and mexico are contemplating granting various types of access rights to third party processors including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients which could have implications for our business as well available informationvisa inc was incorporated in delaware in may 2007 and we completed our initial public offering in march 2008 prior to 2007 when visa was reorganized visa served its member financial institutions through visa international and regional member owned associations e g visa u s a inc and visa canada corporation as part of the 2007 reorganization these associations became a part of visa inc in october 2007 with the exception of

and financial results as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations see item 1 business government regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulations on us our clients and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules affect our existing contractual arrangements increase our compliance costs require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties including competitors in an undesirable manner and reduce our revenue opportunities as discussed in more detail below we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates preferred routing domestic processing requirements currency conversion point of sale transaction rules and practices privacy data use or protection licensing requirements and associated product technology as a result the visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services fees and other important aspects of our business in the regions where we operate our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws such as anti money laundering anti corruption competition privacy and sanctions and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve however we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal penalties litigation investigations and proceedings and damage to our global brands and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of visa products our clients issue the volume of payments we process our revenues our brands our competitive positioning our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services the quality and types of products and services we offer the countries in which our products are used and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products all of which could harm our business increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees merchant discount rates operating rules risk management protocols and other related practices could harm our business regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry see item 1 business government regulation for more information in the u s and many other jurisdictions we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction in the context of credit and debit transactions those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers the reverse is true for certain transactions like atm interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues 19table of contentsinterchange reimbursement fees certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees rules and practices for example regulations adopted by the u s federal reserve cap the maximum u s debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent the dodd frank act also limits issuers and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacts our business the eu s ifr places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross border transactions within the eea 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively eu member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories furthermore the european commission is in the process of conducting an impact assessment of the ifr which could potentially result in lower and or additional interchange fee caps and restrictions countries in other parts of the world including the latin america region have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps for example in march 2017 argentina s central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions in march 2018 brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems such as our competitors closed loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees or reducing certain benefits to consumers which make our products less appealing to consumers some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us including reductions in the fees that we charge which may directly impact our revenues in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business for example many governments including but not limited to governments in india and turkey are using regulation to further drive down merchant discount rates which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions some countries in latin america like peru and chile are relying on antitrust driven regulatory actions that can have implications for how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate the payment system regulator s review of the acquiring market in the united kingdom could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business with increased merchant lobbying we could also begin to see regulatory interest in network fees government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks to support visa products or services or to have the other network s functionality or brand marks on our products as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence for instance new products and capabilities including tokenization push payments and non card based payment flows e g b2b connect could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered in addition the european union s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategies we are also subject to central bank oversight in some markets including brazil russia the united kingdom and within the european union this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirements we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally as well as localized risk management or governance increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system including allowing non traditional financial technology companies to act as issuers or acquirers additionally regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles finally regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other s approaches to regulating the payments industry consequently a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another the risks created by a new law regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings for example our settlement with the european commission on cross border interchange rates could draw the attention of regulators in other parts of the world similarly new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments or vice versa for instance the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange as well 20table of contentsgovernment imposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks brands and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations to varying degrees these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks in the future public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments processing be performed entirely within that country which would prevent us from managing the end to end processing of certain transactions in russia legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions the central bank controlled national payment card system nspk is the only entity allowed to process domestically in china unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark although we have filed an application with the people s bank of china pboc to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china the timing and the procedural steps remain uncertain the approval process might require several years and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a bcci will be approved or if we obtain such license that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks recent regulatory initiatives in india also suggest growing nationalistic priorities including a data localization mandate passed by the government which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment providers furthermore regional groups of countries such as the gulf cooperation countries in the middle east and a number of countries in southeast asia are considering or may consider efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions the african development bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability geopolitical events including sanctions trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify any or all of these activities which could adversely affect our business due to our inability to manage the end to end processing of transactions for cards in certain countries e g russia and thailand we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third party processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or on shore processing co badging and co residency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing for example in china certain banks have issued dual branded cards for which domestic transactions in china are processed by unionpay and transactions outside of china are processed by us or other international payments networks the pboc is contemplating that dual branded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in china s domestic payments market accordingly we have been working with chinese issuers to issue visa only branded cards for international travel and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a bcci license however notwithstanding such efforts the phase out of dual branded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in china mir and unionpay have grown rapidly in russia and china respectively and are actively pursuing international expansion plans which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule which requires that international transactions on visa cards be routed over visanet furthermore although regulatory barriers shield mir and unionpay from competition in russia and china respectively alternate payment providers such as alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce offline and cross border payments which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in china recently with strong backing from china s government a new digital transaction routing system known as netlink was established the pboc allowed alipay and other digital payment providers to invest in netlink it and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with other international payments networks in general national laws that protect domestic providers or processing may increase our costs decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries decrease the number of visa products issued or processed impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands restrict our activities limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products services and innovations force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets and create new competitors all of which could harm our business 21table of contentslaws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for example the eu s general data protection regulation gdpr extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents regardless of the company s location the law requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data although we have an extensive data privacy program that addresses the gdpr requirements our ongoing efforts to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection laws such as the new california consumer privacy act effective as of january 2020 and the brazilian general data protection law effective as of february 2020 may entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer in addition india has adopted a data localization law that requires all payment system operators to store domestic transaction data only in india such data localization requirements have cost implications for us impact our ability to utilize the efficiencies and value of our global network and could affect our strategy furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in tax laws we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the u s internal revenue service the uk s hm revenue customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws in the u s or foreign jurisdictions or changes resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development program of work related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and global base erosion proposal may also materially affect our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report litigation riskswe may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations despite certain protections that are in place we are involved in numerous litigation matters investigations and proceedings asserted by civil litigants governments and enforcement bodies alleging among other things violations of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law and intellectual property law these are referred to as actions in this section details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in note 20 legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report these actions are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations in the event we are found liable in any material action particularly in a large class action lawsuit such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or we incur liability arising from a government investigation we may be required to pay significant awards settlements or fines in addition settlement terms judgments or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify among other things the default interchange reimbursement rates we set the visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules our fees or pricing or the way we do business these actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators investigators governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions which may lead to additional actions against visa finally we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them even if visa is not a defendant 22table of contentsfor certain actions like those that are u s covered litigation or ve territory covered litigation as described in note 5 u s and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20 legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements judgments losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent business riskswe face intense competition in our industry the global payments space is intensely competitive as technology evolves new competitors or methods of payment emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles our products compete with cash checks electronic funds virtual currency payments global or multi regional networks other domestic and closed loop payments systems and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels as the global payments space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our clients other emerging payment providers such as fintechs and other digital payments and technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels our competitors may develop substantially better technology have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources they may offer more effective innovative or a wider range of programs products and services they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition and greater issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements moreover even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from visanet transactions which could hurt our financial results and prospects certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate in different market segments those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory technological and other developments in some cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions some of our competitors including american express discover private label card networks virtual currency providers technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternate payments systems like alipay and wechat pay operate closed loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers government actions or initiatives such as the dodd frank act or the u s federal reserve s fednow initiatives may provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models and may create new competitors including in some cases the government itself similarly regulation in europe under psd2 and the ifr may require us to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participants and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments alternate payment credentials other ledger technologies or payment forms and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example competitors clients network participants and others are developing or participating in alternate payment networks or products such as mobile payment services ecommerce payment services p2p payment services real time and faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ach or direct debits from consumer checking accounts that could reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value added services we provide to support such processing examples include initiatives from the clearing house an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments system early warning services which operates zelle a bank offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real time payments across a variety of payment types including p2p corporate and government disbursement bill pay and deposit check transactions and the libra association which seeks to launch a new stablecoin crypto currency libra coin and global blockchain based payments network 23table of contents similarly many countries are developing or promoting domestic networks switches and real time payment systems to the extent these governments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic transactions and or prohibit international payment networks like visa from participating on those systems we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries furthermore in some regions such as southeast asia under the auspices of the association of southeast asian nations asean some countries are looking into cross border connectivity of such domestic systems parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain parties that access our payment credentials tokens and technologies including clients technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or use our payment credentials tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms participants in the payments industry may merge form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new competing payment services and new or revised industry standards related to emv secure remote commerce cloud based payments tokenization or other payments related technologies set by organizations such as the international organization for standardization american national standards institute world wide web consortium european card standards group pci co and emvco may result in additional costs and expenses for visa and its clients or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services as the competitive landscape is quickly evolving we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses products services and practices we may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of visa s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and maintain our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services while we have certain contractual protections our clients including some of our largest clients generally have flexibility to issue non visa products further in certain circumstances our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients in order to stay competitive we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments adapt to regulatory changes and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services these include up front cash payments fee discounts rebates credits performance based incentives marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options market pressures on pricing incentives fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives fee discounts and rebates it may harm our net revenues and profits in addition it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants in addition if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co brand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors it could result in our business shifting to a competitor which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business 24table of contentsmerchants and processors continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa products certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions such as the u s canada and europe to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory enforcement filing lawsuits and in some cases refusing to accept visa products if they are successful in their efforts we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products for example in the u s certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact the cost of payment card acceptance in addition to ongoing litigation related to the u s migration to emv capable cards and point of sale terminals u s merchant affiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process and some policymakers have concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council in the development of payment card standards additionally some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products to mandate only pin authenticated transactions to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment if successful these efforts could adversely impact consumers usage of our products lead to regulatory enforcement and or litigation increase our compliance and litigation expenses and harm our business we depend on relationships with financial institutions acquirers processors merchants and other third parties as noted above our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties for instance we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace we engage in discussions with merchants acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we also engage in many payment card co branding efforts with merchants who receive incentives from us as emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry we engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem whether as for example an issuer merchant or digital wallet provider as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships in addition we depend on our clients and third parties including vendors and suppliers to process transactions properly provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and otherwise adhere to our operating rules to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their visa branded payment products which could harm our business and reputation our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation or if we experience brand disintermediation our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business we believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing products services and partnerships and uphold our corporate reputation the popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the point of sale and decrease the value of our brand our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including authorization clearing and settlement service disruptions data security breaches compliance failures by visa including our employees agents clients partners or suppliers negative perception of our industry the industries of our clients or visa accepting merchants ill perceived actions by clients partners or other third parties such as sponsorship or co brand partners and fraudulent risky controversial or illegal activities using our payment products if we are unable to maintain our reputation the value of our brand may be impaired which could harm our relationships with clients account holders and the public as well as impact our business 25table of contentsglobal economic political market and social events or conditions may harm our business our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers governments and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in addition more than half of our net revenues are earned outside the u s international cross border transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy therefore adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated large scale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues in addition outbreaks of illnesses pandemics or other local or global health issues political uncertainties international hostilities armed conflict or unrest and natural disasters could impact our operations our clients our activities in a particular location and cross border travel and spend geopolitical trends towards nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirements as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions could limit the expansion of our business in those regions the current trade environment reduces the likelihood of having our bank card clearing institution application in china approved in addition any decline in cross border travel and spend could impact the number of cross border transactions we process and our currency exchange activities which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues a decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well and their decisions could reduce the number of cards accounts and credit lines of their account holders which ultimately impact our revenues they may also implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added services from us any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms which could affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if clients default on their settlement obligations it may also impact our liquidity any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa operating rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business see note 11 settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report the united kingdom s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as brexit in march 2017 the uk government initiated the exit process under article 50 of the treaty of the european union commencing a period of up to two years for the united kingdom and the other eu member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal which was subsequently postponed until january 31 2020 uncertainty over the terms of the united kingdom s departure from the european union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the united kingdom and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results 26table of contentsbrexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and european union we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the european union and as a result our visa operating rules and contractual commitments in the united kingdom and the rest of the european union may be impacted in addition applications may need to be made for regulatory authorization and permission in separate eu member states following brexit these factors may impact our ability to operate and process data in the european union and united kingdom seamlessly this and other brexit related issues may require changes to our legal entity structure and or operations in the united kingdom and the european union any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results technology and cybersecurity risksfailure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity payment technologies ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrencies and new authentication technologies such as biometrics distributed ledger and blockchain technologies as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies it is difficult however to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated moreover some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual property related lawsuits or claims potentially impacting our development efforts and or requiring us to obtain licenses if we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients impact our intellectual property or licensing rights harm our business and impact our future growth a disruption failure or breach of our networks or systems including as a result of cyber attacks could harm our business our cybersecurity and processing systems as well as those of financial institutions merchants and third party service providers have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience errors interruptions delays or damage from a number of causes including power outages hardware software and network failures computer viruses malware or other destructive software internal design manual or usage errors cyber attacks terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic events natural disasters and severe weather conditions furthermore our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyber attack attempts we have been and may continue to be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions merchants or third party processors we are also aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data security breaches affecting their customers some of whom were visa account holders such attacks and breaches have resulted and may continue to result in fraudulent activity and ultimately financial losses to visa s clients and it is difficult to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyber attacks phishing and social engineering schemes particularly on our internet applications could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our third party service providers because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade systems change frequently have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the security measures and procedures we our financial institution and merchant clients other merchants and third party service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches cyber attacks or system failures in some cases the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards or whose hardware software or network services may be subject to error defect delay or outage although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity and supplier risk management programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data and to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats 27table of contentsthese events could significantly disrupt our operations

market ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations have made it more difficult for employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which we have

under our u s retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our u s covered litigation all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock our series b and series c preferred stock will become convertible into class a common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims conversion of our class b and class c common stock into class a common stock or our series b and series c preferred stock into class a common stock would increase the amount of class a common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class a common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class a common stockholders holders of our class b and c common stock and series b and series c preferred stock may have different interests than our class a common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock and in certain specified circumstances holders of our series b and series c preferred stock can vote on certain significant transactions with respect to our class b and c common stock these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law with respect to our series b and series c preferred stock voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series b and series c preferred stock would either i receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or ii receive securities cash or other property that is different from what our class a common stockholders would receive because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class a common stock are our current and former financial institution clients they may have interests that diverge from our class a common stockholders as a result the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class a common stockholders delaware law provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could make a merger takeover attempt or change in control difficult provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger takeover attempt or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable for example except for limited exceptions no person may beneficially own more than 15 of our class a common stock or 15 of our total outstanding common stock on an as converted basis unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5 of our total outstanding common stock on an as converted basis the affirmative votes of the class b and c common stock and series b and series c preferred stock are required for certain types of consolidations or
